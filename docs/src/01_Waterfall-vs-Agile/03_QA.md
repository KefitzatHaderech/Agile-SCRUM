# Waterfall vs. Agile: Detailed Comparison and Minimum Viable Product Development

- What is the main difference in the approach to software development between Waterfall and Agile methodologies?
  - The main difference between Waterfall and Agile methodologies is that Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins, while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that allows for continuous feedback and adjustments throughout the development process.

---

- List the primary stages of the Waterfall methodology.
  - The primary stages of the Waterfall methodology are:
    1. Requirement Analysis
    2. System Design
    3. Implementation (Coding)
    4. Integration and Testing
    5. Deployment
    6. Maintenance

---

- How long does each phase typically take in the Waterfall methodology?
  - The duration of each phase in the Waterfall methodology can vary greatly depending on the project's scope, complexity, and specific requirements. However, a rough estimate for each phase might look like this:

    1. **Requirement Analysis**: 1-2 months
    2. **System Design**: 2-4 months
    3. **Implementation (Coding)**: 3-6 months
    4. **Integration and Testing**: 2-4 months
    5. **Deployment**: 1-2 months
    6. **Maintenance**: Ongoing

  These timeframes are highly variable and can be longer or shorter depending on the project's specifics and the organization's processes.

- Why is customer feedback delayed in the Waterfall model?
  - Customer feedback is delayed in the Waterfall model because it follows a sequential and linear approach, where each phase must be fully completed before moving on to the next one. This means that the product is not available for review or feedback until the later stages of the process, typically after the implementation and testing phases. Consequently, customers do not see a working version of the product until it is nearly complete, limiting their ability to provide early input and requiring changes to be made late in the development cycle, which can be costly and time-consuming.

- Describe the iterative process in Agile methodology.

  - The iterative process in Agile methodology involves breaking down the project into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Each iteration follows a cycle of planning, development, testing, and review. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the iterative process:

      1. **Planning**: The team identifies and prioritizes features from the product backlog to be developed in the upcoming iteration. They define the goals and deliverables for the sprint, ensuring they are achievable within the time frame.

      2. **Development**: During this phase, the team works on coding and building the selected features. Collaboration and communication are key, with daily stand-up meetings to track progress, address obstacles, and adjust tasks as needed.

      3. **Testing**: Continuous testing is performed throughout the iteration to ensure the new features work correctly and integrate smoothly with the existing system. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests.

      4. **Review**: At the end of the iteration, the team conducts a sprint review or demo to showcase the completed features to stakeholders. Feedback is gathered to ensure the product meets expectations and to identify any necessary adjustments.

      5. **Retrospective**: The team holds a retrospective meeting to reflect on the iteration, discussing what went well, what didn’t, and how processes can be improved for the next sprint.

      This cycle repeats with each iteration, allowing for continuous improvement, early detection of issues, and regular incorporation of customer feedback. The iterative process enables flexibility and adaptability, ensuring the final product better meets user needs and expectations.
