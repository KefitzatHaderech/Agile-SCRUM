# Sprint Events in SCRUM and SAFe

## Overview

In the SCRUM framework, a sprint is a time-boxed period during which specific work must be completed and made ready for review. Sprints are the heartbeat of SCRUM, where ideas are turned into value. This tutorial will delve into the structure and events within a sprint, offering a detailed examination of their roles and interrelationships, ensuring a rigorous and accurate understanding of SCRUM principles.

## Definition and Purpose of a Sprint

A sprint acts as a container for all other SCRUM events. The primary purpose of a sprint is to deliver a potentially shippable product increment, which is a functional and valuable addition to the product being developed. This increment is the outcome of the work completed during the sprint.

## Key Events Within a Sprint

Each sprint comprises the following key events:

1. **Sprint Planning**
2. **Daily Scrum**
3. **Sprint Review**
4. **Sprint Retrospective**

These events facilitate structured communication, collaboration, and continuous improvement within the SCRUM team.

## Detailed Examination of Sprint Events

## 1. Sprint Planning

**Objective:** Sprint planning sets the stage for the work to be performed during the sprint. The SCRUM team collaborates to define the sprint goal, which is a concise statement of what will be achieved during the sprint.

**Activities:**
- **Defining the Sprint Goal:** The product owner and team identify the most critical objectives for the sprint.
- **Selecting Backlog Items:** The team selects items from the product backlog that they commit to completing during the sprint.
- **Creating the Sprint Backlog:** The selected backlog items are broken down into smaller tasks, forming the sprint backlog.

**Duration:** Typically lasts up to eight hours for a one-month sprint, proportional for shorter sprints.

## 2. Daily Scrum

**Objective:** The daily scrum is a time-boxed event of 15 minutes that occurs every day of the sprint. Its purpose is to synchronize the team's activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

**Activities:**
- Each team member answers three questions:
  1. What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet the sprint goal?
  2. What will I do today to help the team meet the sprint goal?
  3. Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the team from meeting the sprint goal?

**Duration:** 15 minutes, held at the same time and place each day.

## 3. Sprint Review

**Objective:** The sprint review is held at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed. The SCRUM team and stakeholders collaborate to review what was accomplished during the sprint and discuss what to do next.

**Activities:**
- **Presentation of the Increment:** The team demonstrates the work completed during the sprint.
- **Feedback Collection:** Stakeholders provide feedback on the increment.
- **Backlog Refinement:** Adjustments are made to the product backlog based on the feedback received.

**Duration:** Typically lasts up to four hours for a one-month sprint, proportional for shorter sprints.

## 4. Sprint Retrospective

**Objective:** The sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the SCRUM team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next sprint.

**Activities:**
- **Reflection:** The team reflects on the past sprint regarding people, relationships, process, and tools.
- **Identification of Improvements:** The team identifies what went well and what could be improved.
- **Actionable Plan:** A plan for implementing improvements in the next sprint is developed.

**Duration:** Typically lasts up to three hours for a one-month sprint, proportional for shorter sprints.

## The Sprint as a Container

The sprint serves as a container for all these events, ensuring that each occurs within the boundaries of the sprint's time frame. The following diagram illustrates the structure and sequence of events within a sprint:

```
Sprint
│
├── Sprint Planning (Day 1)
│
├── Daily Scrum (Days 1-14)
│
├── Sprint Review (Day 14)
│
└── Sprint Retrospective (Day 14)
```

Each sprint begins with sprint planning and ends with a sprint review and retrospective. The daily scrum occurs each day throughout the sprint, ensuring continuous communication and collaboration.

## Continuous Delivery of Product Increments

At the end of each sprint, the SCRUM team delivers a product increment. This increment is a step towards the final product, adding new functionality and value. The continuous delivery of increments ensures that the product evolves iteratively and incrementally.

The diagram below exemplifies the delivery of product increments over six sprints:

```
Sprints:    1       2       3       4       5       6
            |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
Increments:  +       +       +       +       +       +
```

In this example, each sprint results in a new increment, contributing to the overall product development.

## Conclusion

In summary, the sprint is a fundamental component of the SCRUM framework, acting as a container for essential events that facilitate structured collaboration and continuous improvement. Each event within the sprint serves a specific purpose, ensuring that the team remains aligned and focused on delivering value through product increments. Understanding and effectively implementing these events is crucial for the success of any SCRUM team.
