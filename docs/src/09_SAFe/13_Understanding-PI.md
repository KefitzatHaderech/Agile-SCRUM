# PI Planning in SAFe

## Understanding PI Planning in SAFe

### Introduction

Program Increment (PI) Planning is a crucial event within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) that ensures alignment among all teams involved in an Agile Release Train (ART). This guide provides a detailed examination of PI Planning, highlighting its importance, structure, and execution.

### What is PI Planning?

PI Planning is a cadence-based event that serves as the heartbeat of the Agile Release Train. It is a recurring event that occurs every 8 to 10 weeks, depending on the organization's specific cadence. The primary purpose of PI Planning is to align all teams within the ART to a shared mission and vision. This alignment is critical to ensuring that all teams are moving in the same direction and working towards common goals.

### Importance of PI Planning

PI Planning is the main event within an ART, and its importance cannot be overstated. It brings together various individual Agile teams to align their work with the overall mission and vision of the solution. Without this alignment, teams may drift in different directions, leading to inefficiencies and a failure to achieve the desired outcomes.

### Key Objectives of PI Planning

1. **Alignment**: Ensuring all teams understand and are committed to the shared mission and vision.
2. **Collaboration**: Facilitating interaction among team members, product management, and stakeholders.
3. **Prioritization**: Establishing feature priorities based on feedback from various sources.
4. **Planning**: Developing detailed plans for the upcoming PI, including story planning and high-level estimates.
5. **Dependency Management**: Identifying and resolving dependencies among teams and with external suppliers.

### Structure of PI Planning

PI Planning is typically a two-day in-person event. However, if conducted virtually, it can extend to three or four days to accommodate different time zones.

#### Participants

1. **Agile Teams**: All team members participate in story planning and estimation.
2. **Product Owners and Product Managers**: Own the prioritization of features and gather feedback from stakeholders.
3. **System Team**: Supports the integration of the ART.
4. **Architects and UX Designers**: Provide guidance on governance, interfaces, and dependencies.

#### Agenda

1. **Day 1**:
   - **Business Context**: Product management presents the vision and priorities.
   - **Team Breakouts**: Teams plan their work and identify dependencies.
   - **Draft Plan Review**: Teams present their initial plans and get feedback.

2. **Day 2**:
   - **Plan Adjustments**: Teams adjust their plans based on feedback.
   - **Management Review**: Senior leaders review and provide final adjustments.
   - **Confidence Vote**: Teams vote on their confidence in the plan.

### Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Product Management**: Owns feature prioritization and gathers feedback from stakeholders. They are the ultimate decision-makers on feature priorities.
2. **Agile Teams**: Own story planning and high-level estimates. Each team is responsible for planning their own stories and providing estimates.
3. **Architects and UX Designers**: Work as intermediaries for governance, interfaces, and dependencies. They advise on enablers and infrastructure items and help resolve dependencies.

### Execution of PI Planning

1. **Preparation**: Before the event, product management prepares the vision and roadmap. Teams review their backlogs and identify potential dependencies.
2. **Conducting the Event**: The event follows the structured agenda, with teams breaking out into smaller groups to plan their work and then coming together to review and adjust plans.
3. **Post-Planning**: After the event, teams commit to their plans, and the ART begins executing the PI. Regular sync meetings and reviews ensure that the ART stays on track.

### Conclusion

PI Planning is a fundamental component of SAFe, providing a structured approach to aligning multiple Agile teams towards a common goal. By ensuring that all teams are aligned, have clear priorities, and understand their dependencies, PI Planning facilitates the successful delivery of complex solutions. The rigorous execution of PI Planning helps maintain the rhythm and efficiency of the ART, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the organization.

This guide underscores the significance of PI Planning and provides a detailed framework for conducting it effectively within the SAFe methodology.
