# Utilization of the Scrum Framework at the Team Level in SAFe

## Overview

This tutorial provides an in-depth examination of the Scrum framework's application at the team level within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). The focus is on understanding how Scrum facilitates the development of new features, user stories, and functionalities. Additionally, the distinction between using Scrum and Kanban within SAFe is addressed, emphasizing their appropriate contexts.

## Scrum vs. Kanban in SAFe

In SAFe, teams can choose between the Scrum framework and the Kanban framework, depending on the nature of their work:

- **Scrum Framework**: Preferred for developing new features, user stories, and functionalities. It is ideal for projects requiring structured planning, iterative development, and regular reviews.
- **Kanban Framework**: Suitable for tasks involving customer service or bug fixes, where work items are small and continuous flow is needed. Kanban's flexibility allows for quick handling of individual tasks without the need for fixed iterations.

## Scrum Framework in Detail

## Planning and Backlog Management

1. **User Stories Allocation**: 
    - User stories are assigned to agile teams during the planning exercise. These stories form the team-level backlog.
    - There are two types of user stories:
        - **Enabler Stories (Red)**: Technical building blocks necessary for developing business functionalities.
        - **Business Stories (Blue)**: Directly related to business value and user requirements.

2. **Prioritization**:
    - The Product Owner prioritizes the user stories in the team backlog, ensuring that the highest priority stories are addressed first.

3. **Iteration Planning**:
    - **Capacity Determination**: The team assesses the availability of each member within the sprint, calculating the total capacity.
    - **Estimation**: User stories brought forward by the Product Owner are estimated in detail. Developers may ask questions to refine their understanding and the granularity of the stories.
    - **Capacity Matching**: The team matches available capacity with the estimated effort required for the user stories. This determines the number of stories that can be committed to the iteration.

4. **Iteration Backlog**:
    - Stories that fit within the team's capacity are moved to the iteration backlog.
    - An iteration goal is defined, outlining the objectives for the iteration.
    - Excess stories are returned to the team backlog.

## Execution and Daily Operations

1. **Iteration Execution**:
    - Iterations (also known as sprints) are typically two-week time-boxed periods where the team designs, builds, tests, and delivers user stories.
    - Daily team sync meetings (Daily Stand-ups) are held for 15 minutes. During these meetings, team members discuss progress, impediments, and adjustments to the plan.

2. **Iteration Review**:
    - At the end of the iteration, an iteration review is conducted.
    - The Product Owner verifies the progress of user stories against the Definition of Done (DoD).
    - The team and stakeholders review the functionality developed, gather feedback, and demonstrate the completed work.

3. **Integration and Release**:
    - The functionality developed during the iteration is integrated with work from other teams within the Agile Release Train.
    - The integrated increment is then released to production.

## Continuous Improvement

1. **Iteration Retrospective**:
    - The team conducts a retrospective to review processes, tools, and ways of working.
    - They identify what went well, what did not, and determine actionable improvement items.
    - The highest priority improvement items are added to the next iteration backlog to ensure continuous improvement in the team's practices.

## Conclusion

The Scrum framework at the team level in SAFe provides a structured approach to developing new features and functionalities. It emphasizes iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous improvement. By understanding and applying these principles, teams can effectively manage their workloads, deliver high-quality products, and adapt to changing requirements. This structured yet flexible approach ensures that the team can respond to customer needs while maintaining a high standard of work.
