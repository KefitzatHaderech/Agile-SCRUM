# Developing Epics, Features, and Stories in SAFe

## Introduction

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a comprehensive system for implementing Lean-Agile development at enterprise scale. One of the critical components of SAFe is the structured approach to capturing requirements through various artifacts such as Epics, Features, and Stories. This tutorial will provide a detailed overview of these artifacts and their roles in SAFe.

## Epics

### Definition and Purpose

In SAFe, an Epic is a significant solution development initiative that captures substantial investment within a portfolio. Epics represent large-scale efforts that align with the strategic objectives of the organization. They are typically associated with significant business cases and are intended to deliver considerable value.

### Types of Epics

1. **Business Epics:** These are customer-facing and deliver direct business value. They are represented in blue color.
2. **Enabler Epics:** These support business epics by extending the architectural runway or enabling capabilities. They are represented in red color.

### Characteristics of Epics

- **Significant Investment:** Epics involve large-scale efforts that require considerable resources.
- **Portfolio Level:** Epics are managed at the portfolio level to ensure alignment with organizational strategy.
- **Decomposition:** Epics are decomposed into multiple features to facilitate incremental development and delivery.

## Features

### Definition and Purpose

A Feature is a service that fulfills a stakeholder need. It is a smaller, more manageable unit of work compared to an Epic. Features are essential for implementing the functionalities that make up an Epic.

### Characteristics of Features

- **Name:** Each feature must have a distinct name.
- **Benefit Hypothesis:** This is an assumption regarding the value or benefit the feature will deliver.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Defines the conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete.
- **Size:** Features are sized to fit within a Program Increment (PI). If a feature is too large, it must be split into smaller features to fit within one PI.

### Types of Features

1. **Business Features:** Directly deliver business value and are represented in blue color.
2. **Enabler Features:** Support the delivery of business features by providing necessary technical infrastructure and capabilities. They are represented in red color.

## Stories

### Definition and Purpose

A Story is a short description of a piece of desired functionality from the perspective of the user. Stories are the smallest unit of work in SAFe and are essential for incremental development.

### Characteristics of Stories

- **User-Centric:** Written from the perspective of the end user to ensure the delivered functionality meets their needs.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Defines the conditions under which the story is considered complete.
- **Decomposability:** Stories can be further decomposed into tasks if necessary.

### Types of Stories

1. **Business Stories:** Deliver direct business functionality and value.
2. **Enabler Stories:** Provide technical infrastructure and support necessary for implementing business stories.

## Enablers

### Definition and Purpose

Enablers support activities needed to extend the architectural runway and provide future business functionality. They include work necessary to support the development of business features and stories.

### Characteristics of Enablers

- **Support Activities:** Include foundational work such as setting up databases, establishing development environments, or improving infrastructure.
- **Decomposition:** Enablers can be broken down into smaller units similar to features and stories based on their size and complexity.

### Levels of Enablers

1. **Epic-Level Enablers:** Large initiatives that span multiple PIs.
2. **Feature-Level Enablers:** Support features within a single PI.
3. **Story-Level Enablers:** Smallest enabler activities, captured in the team backlog.

## Conclusion

The structured approach to capturing requirements in SAFe through Epics, Features, and Stories ensures that large-scale development efforts are manageable and aligned with business objectives. This hierarchy facilitates incremental delivery, allowing organizations to respond quickly to changes while maintaining strategic alignment.

By understanding the characteristics and purposes of Epics, Features, and Stories, teams can effectively plan, manage, and deliver value in a SAFe environment.
