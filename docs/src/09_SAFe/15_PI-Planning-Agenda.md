# Two-Day PI Planning in SAFe

## Overview of PI Planning in SAFe

Program Increment (PI) Planning is a significant event within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) where all teams within an Agile Release Train (ART) synchronize and plan their work for the upcoming increment, typically lasting 8-12 weeks. PI Planning ensures alignment, sets clear goals, and identifies dependencies and risks. When conducted in person, PI Planning spans two days; remotely, it extends to 3-4 days to accommodate virtual collaboration.

## Day 1 Agenda

Day one of PI Planning is crucial for setting the context and aligning the entire ART on the vision and goals. The agenda is structured to ensure a thorough understanding of the business context, product vision, architectural guidance, and initial planning.

1. **Business Context (8:00 AM - 9:00 AM)**
   - **Objective**: The business owner, typically the CEO or a department head, presents the broader business context. This includes market conditions, strategic goals, and how the product fits into the organizational strategy. Tools such as SWOT analysis may be used.
   - **Details**: This session aligns the ART with the business priorities and provides a foundation for understanding the strategic importance of the upcoming PI.

2. **Product/Solution Vision (9:00 AM - 10:30 AM)**
   - **Objective**: Product Management presents the vision for the product or solution.
   - **Details**: This session ensures all ART members have a unified understanding of what the product aims to achieve, its features, and the customer needs it addresses. It also covers the long-term vision and the expected outcomes.

3. **Architecture Vision and Development Practices (10:30 AM - 12:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: System or Enterprise Architects outline the architectural vision and best practices for development.
   - **Details**: This includes discussing the architectural runway, technological considerations, and development best practices that should be adhered to during the PI.

4. **Planning Context and Lunch (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Provide context for planning while attendees have lunch.
   - **Details**: This session sets the stage for team breakouts, discussing logistical details, capacity, and expectations.

5. **Team Breakouts (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Teams decompose features into user stories, estimate effort, and draft initial plans.
   - **Details**: Teams review allocated features, create user stories, estimate story points, and consider capacity. They identify dependencies, risks, and necessary clarifications, and draft their PI objectives. Collaboration tools and visual aids like boards and digital tools facilitate this process.

6. **Draft Plan Review (5:00 PM - 6:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Teams present their draft plans and PI objectives to the ART.
   - **Details**: This session allows for initial feedback, identification of inter-team dependencies, and preliminary risk assessment.

7. **Management Review and Problem Solving (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Management reviews draft plans, addresses impediments, and proposes solutions.
   - **Details**: Managers assess the feasibility of the plans, resolve cross-team dependencies, and provide guidance on resource allocation, prioritization, and problem resolution.

## Day 2 Agenda

Day two focuses on refining plans based on management feedback, finalizing objectives, addressing risks, and ensuring the entire ART is confident in their commitments.

1. **Planning Adjustments (8:00 AM - 9:00 AM)**
   - **Objective**: Adjust plans based on feedback from the management review.
   - **Details**: Teams make necessary adjustments to their plans, reallocate work if needed, and prepare for further breakouts.

2. **Team Breakouts (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Refine plans and ensure alignment with management adjustments.
   - **Details**: Teams finalize user story estimates, adjust plans based on new inputs, and finalize PI objectives. Collaboration continues to ensure all dependencies and risks are addressed.

3. **Lunch (12:00 PM - 1:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Provide a break while allowing informal discussions on planning.
   - **Details**: Teams can discuss remaining issues and finalize any outstanding details over lunch.

4. **ROAMing Risks (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Identify, discuss, and mitigate risks.
   - **Details**: Teams classify risks as Resolved, Owned, Accepted, or Mitigated (ROAM). Strategies for risk mitigation are developed and documented.

5. **PI Confidence Vote (2:00 PM - 3:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Gauge the confidence of the ART in meeting PI objectives.
   - **Details**: Using a voting system (e.g., fist of five), team members express their confidence levels. Low confidence scores prompt discussions to address concerns and enhance confidence.

6. **Plan Rework (if necessary) (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Rework plans if confidence is low.
   - **Details**: If significant issues are identified, teams rework their plans until sufficient confidence is achieved.

7. **Planning Retrospective and Moving Forward (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)**
   - **Objective**: Reflect on the PI Planning process and identify improvements.
   - **Details**: The ART conducts a retrospective to evaluate what went well and what could be improved for future PI Planning events. Action items are documented to enhance the process.

# Conclusion

The two-day PI Planning event is a cornerstone of SAFe, ensuring alignment, collaboration, and a shared understanding of the goals and deliverables for the upcoming increment. By following a structured agenda, teams can effectively plan, identify dependencies, address risks, and build confidence in their ability to meet their commitments. This meticulous approach to planning is essential for the success of Agile teams operating at scale.
