# Artifacts & Commitments

## Introduction

In the context of Scrum, artifacts and commitments play a crucial role in ensuring transparency, focus, and measurability of progress. This tutorial provides a detailed and precise explanation of these concepts, critically examining the structure and purpose of Scrum artifacts and commitments.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum defines three primary artifacts: the Product Backlog, the Sprint Backlog, and the Increment. Each artifact is designed to maximize transparency of key information.

1. **Product Backlog**

   The Product Backlog is a dynamic, ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

   - **Example**: Suppose a product director or stakeholder proposes an idea to build a new website. The Product Owner (PO) collaborates with the Scrum Team and stakeholders to translate this idea into a Product Goal, which in this case is "creation of a new website."
   - **Structure**: The Product Backlog consists of various items known as Product Backlog Items (PBIs). These items are prioritized and refined over time.
     - **Bottom of the Backlog**: Contains rough, high-level requirements or modules that are not yet refined.
     - **Middle of the Backlog**: Contains more detailed requirements, refined to a medium level.
     - **Top of the Backlog**: Contains the most refined and prioritized requirements that are ready to be worked on in upcoming sprints.

   - **Commitment**: The commitment for the Product Backlog is the Product Goal. Only one Product Goal is active at any given time for a product.

2. **Sprint Backlog**

   The Sprint Backlog is a set of PBIs selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. It is the forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.

   - **Sprint Planning**: During the Sprint Planning event, the Scrum Team, which includes the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, selects PBIs from the Product Backlog to work on in the upcoming sprint. The team collaboratively defines the Sprint Goal.
   - **Example**: For the website creation project, the Sprint Goal might be "design of the basic structure of the website" for the current sprint.
   - **Commitment**: The commitment for the Sprint Backlog is the Sprint Goal. This goal provides a clear, short-term objective for the team to achieve within the sprint duration.

3. **Increment**

   An Increment is the sum of all the PBIs completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be in a usable condition and meet the Scrum Teamâ€™s definition of "Done."

   - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: The DoD is a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete. It ensures that the Increment is of high quality and usable by the end user.
   - **Commitment**: The commitment for the Increment is the Definition of Done. This ensures that each Increment is potentially shippable and meets quality standards.

## Measuring Progress

The commitments associated with each artifact provide a mechanism to measure progress.

- **Sprint Review**: At the end of the Sprint, the team compares the Increment with the Sprint Goal to assess if the Sprint was successful. The progress towards the Product Goal is evaluated by assessing completed Increments over multiple Sprints.
- **Transparency and Focus**: The commitments ensure that everyone in the Scrum Team is aware of the current focus (Sprint Goal) and the long-term vision (Product Goal). They also provide a basis for measuring progress and making informed decisions.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Scrum defines specific roles to facilitate the process and uphold the values of Scrum:

1. **Product Owner (PO)**

   - Manages the Product Backlog.
   - Collaborates with stakeholders to understand and prioritize requirements.
   - Ensures the team understands the items in the Product Backlog.

2. **Scrum Master**

   - Coaches the Scrum Team and organization in Scrum practices.
   - Facilitates Scrum events and removes impediments.
   - Helps the team to become self-organizing and self-managing.

3. **Developers**

   - Develop the product Increment.
   - Participate in refining the Product Backlog and planning Sprints.
   - Ensure the Increment meets the Definition of Done.

## Summary

Understanding and correctly implementing the artifacts and commitments in Scrum are essential for maintaining transparency, focus, and progress measurability. The Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment, along with their associated commitments (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, and Definition of Done), provide a clear framework for managing complex projects and delivering high-quality products. The roles within Scrum ensure that the team is well-coached, self-organizing, and aligned with the principles and values of Scrum.
