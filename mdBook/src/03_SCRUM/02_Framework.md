# Scrum Framework

## Introduction

Scrum is a lightweight framework designed to help teams work together to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products. It is grounded in empiricism and lean thinking, which form its core principles. Understanding these foundational concepts is crucial for mastering Scrum.

## Core Principles of Scrum

### Empiricism

Empiricism in Scrum is about making decisions based on observation, experience, and experimentation. It emphasizes the importance of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, allowing teams to learn from their experiences and adjust their processes accordingly.

### Lean Thinking

Lean thinking aims to maximize value by eliminating waste. In the context of Scrum, waste can be in the form of unnecessary steps in the process or non-essential features in the product. By focusing on delivering only what is necessary, teams can work more efficiently and effectively.

## The Three Pillars of Scrum

Scrum is upheld by three pillars:

1. **Transparency**: Ensures that all aspects of the process that affect the outcome must be visible to those responsible for the outcome. Transparency requires those aspects to be defined by a common standard so that observers share a common understanding.

2. **Inspection**: Frequent inspections of Scrum artifacts and progress toward a Sprint Goal detect variances. Inspections are most beneficial when performed diligently by skilled inspectors at the point of work.

3. **Adaptation**: If an inspector determines that one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted. These adjustments must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

## Scrum Framework

The Scrum framework consists of specific roles, events, and artifacts. It is designed to be simple to understand but difficult to master. Mastery requires practice and a deep understanding of the underlying principles.

### Roles (Accountabilities)

1. **Product Owner**: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. This role involves managing the Product Backlog, ensuring it is visible, transparent, and clear to all.

2. **Scrum Master**: The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They help everyone understand Scrum theory and practice and ensure the team adheres to Scrum practices.

3. **Developers**: Developers are the people in the Scrum Team who are committed to creating any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint. They self-organize to perform the work.

### Events

1. **The Sprint**: The Sprint is a time-box of one month or less during which a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort.

2. **Sprint Planning**: This event involves the entire Scrum Team and occurs at the beginning of the Sprint to define what can be delivered in the Sprint and how that work will be achieved. It is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint.

3. **Daily Scrum**: A 15-minute event for the Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

4. **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.

5. **Sprint Retrospective**: This event occurs after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. It is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

### Artifacts

1. **Product Backlog**: An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog.

2. **Sprint Backlog**: The set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.

3. **Increment**: The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," meaning it must be in a useable condition and meet the Scrum Team's Definition of Done.

## Commitments

Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus:

- **Product Backlog**: Commitment is the Product Goal.
- **Sprint Backlog**: Commitment is the Sprint Goal.
- **Increment**: Commitment is the Definition of Done.

## The Five Scrum Values

The success of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values:

1. **Commitment**: Team members personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.
2. **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.
3. **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work.
4. **Respect**: Scrum Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.
5. **Courage**: Scrum Team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

## Detailed Explanation of Scrum Roles

### Product Owner

The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product. This involves:

- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items.
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions.
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.
- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team by:

- Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality.
- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done.
- Removing impediments to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress.
- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the time-box.

### Developers

The Developers are responsible for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog.
- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done.
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal.
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

## Detailed Explanation of Scrum Events

### The Sprint

- **Duration**: Sprints are time-boxed to one month or less.
- **Purpose**: To create a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment.
- **Structure**: Each Sprint contains and consists of Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

### Sprint Planning

- **Purpose**: To define what can be delivered in the Sprint and how that work will be achieved.
- **Participants**: The entire Scrum Team.
- **Time-box**: Eight hours for a one-month Sprint, proportionally less for shorter Sprints.

### Daily Scrum

- **Purpose**: To inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog.
