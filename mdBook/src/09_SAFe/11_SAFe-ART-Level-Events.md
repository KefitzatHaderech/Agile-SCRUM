# SAFe ART Level Events

## Overview

In the context of the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), the Agile Release Train (ART) operates as a long-lived team of Agile teams, aligned to a common business and technology mission. ART level events play a crucial role in coordinating efforts across teams, aligning them towards common objectives, and ensuring the successful delivery of value. This guide provides an in-depth exploration of these events, highlighting their significance and detailing the processes involved.

## 1. Preparing for PI Planning

**Objective:**
Preparation for PI (Program Increment) planning involves several key stakeholders, including Product Owners, Product Managers, and team leaders. The primary goal is to ensure that all necessary groundwork is laid for effective planning and execution of the upcoming PI.

**Activities:**

- **Feature Identification:** Stakeholders collaborate to identify and prioritize the features to be developed in the upcoming PI.
- **Content Preparation:** Detailed content required for these features is prepared, ensuring clarity and completeness.
- **Solution Vision Update:** If it is the first PI, the solution vision is captured. For subsequent PIs, the solution vision is reviewed and updated as needed.
- **Other Preparatory Activities:** Additional tasks include aligning on architectural goals, updating roadmaps, and ensuring readiness for the PI planning event.

## 2. PI Planning

**Objective:**
PI Planning is a cornerstone event where the entire Agile Release Train comes together to plan the work for the next PI, typically spanning ten weeks or five iterations.

**Activities:**

- **Review of Prepared Artifacts:** Key artifacts such as the top ten features, solution vision, architecture, and roadmap are presented and discussed.
- **Team Planning:** Agile teams within the ART develop their plans, identifying the stories and tasks required to implement the prioritized features.
- **Alignment and Synchronization:** Teams synchronize their plans to ensure alignment, address dependencies, and mitigate risks.
- **Commitment:** Teams commit to their plans, creating a shared understanding of what will be delivered in the upcoming PI.

## 3. Coach Sync

**Objective:**
The Coach Sync, also known as the Scrum of Scrums, is a regular meeting where Scrum Masters from various Agile teams, along with the Release Train Engineer (RTE), come together to discuss progress and address impediments.

**Activities:**

- **Impediment Resolution:** Discuss obstacles affecting team progress and collaborate to find solutions.
- **Dependency Management:** Address and resolve dependencies between teams.
- **Progress Review:** Review the progress of each team and the overall ART to ensure alignment with PI objectives.
- **Coordination:** Ensure that the ART is on track to meet iteration and PI goals.

## 4. Product Owner (PO) Sync

**Objective:**
The PO Sync is a regular meeting where Product Owners from various teams, along with Product Management, come together to discuss the progress and align on priorities.

**Activities:**

- **Progress Review:** Review the progress of user stories and features.
- **Impediment Resolution:** Discuss obstacles and work towards their resolution.
- **Alignment:** Ensure that all teams are aligned with the overall product vision and objectives.
- **Feedback Integration:** Incorporate feedback from stakeholders to refine priorities and plans.

## 5. ART Sync

**Objective:**
The ART Sync is a combined event that merges the Coach Sync and PO Sync, providing a comprehensive forum for discussing both delivery and product management aspects.

**Activities:**

- **Unified Review:** Review progress, impediments, and dependencies from both a team and product perspective.
- **Integrated Planning:** Align on priorities and plans across the ART.
- **Collaboration:** Foster collaboration among Scrum Masters, Product Owners, Product Management, and the RTE.

## 6. System Demo

**Objective:**
The System Demo is a regular event where the integrated functionality developed by the entire ART is demonstrated to stakeholders.

**Activities:**

- **Functionality Demonstration:** Showcase the combined product increment delivered by all teams.
- **Feedback Collection:** Gather feedback from stakeholders, including Product Owners and Product Managers.
- **Review and Adaptation:** Review the delivered functionality and make necessary adjustments based on feedback.

## 7. Inspect and Adapt

**Objective:**
The Inspect and Adapt event is a retrospective at the ART level, aimed at continuous improvement by reflecting on the past PI's performance.

**Activities:**

- **Reflection:** Discuss what went well, what did not go well, and identify areas for improvement.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Perform a thorough analysis to understand the root causes of issues.
- **Action Planning:** Develop action plans to implement improvements, which are then added to the backlog for the upcoming PI.

## Conclusion

ART level events are integral to the successful implementation of SAFe, ensuring that Agile teams within the ART are aligned, impediments are resolved, and continuous improvement is achieved. Each event serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the ART in delivering value to the organization.
